# AI PM Foundations

This repository is a Product Manager portfolio focused on **AI product thinking**, **system design**, and **decision-making** for enterprise-grade AI products.
Across these documents, I emphasize enforcing policy **before generation**, validating outputs **after generation**, and preserving **human-in-the-loop** workflows to build trustworthy enterprise AI systems.
It is designed to help hiring managers and teams understand how I approach:
- LLM product design (RAG, tool use, human-in-the-loop)
- Evaluation and success metrics
- Risk, security, and trust
- Cost/latency tradeoffs and reliability
